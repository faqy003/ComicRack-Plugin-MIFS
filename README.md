# Modern Image Formats Support for ComicRack 
Two new formats has been added to ComicRack.
- [AVIF](https://aomediacodec.github.io/av1-avif/) - Better at lossy compression. Same size with best quality. However, it's not that good at high fidelity & lossless use.
- [JpegXL](https://jpeg.org/jpegxl/) - Better at lossless compression. 30% smaller than PNG format in general. Next generation of jpeg format. Only format that support lossless convert from original jpg.

Something worthy mentioning about these formats:
- Due to the inside mechanics of ComicRack, some new features of these formats are not support. (e.g HDR & animation)

> I made this project only for practice ,not intended for constant maintenance.
